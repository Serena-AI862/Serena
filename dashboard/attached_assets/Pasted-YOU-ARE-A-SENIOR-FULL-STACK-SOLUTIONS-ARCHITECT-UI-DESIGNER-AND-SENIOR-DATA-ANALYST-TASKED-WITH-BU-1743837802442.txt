### TASK 1: LOGIN UI + AUTH LOGIC

1. DESIGN A CLEAN, PROFESSIONAL LOGIN PAGE THAT MATCHES THE ATTACHED IMAGE:
   - Centered login form
   - Title: **Serena AI Real Estate**
   - Subtitle: _Call Analytics Dashboard_
   - Fields: **Email**, **Password**, "Remember me" checkbox
   - Include "Forgot password?" and "Sign Up" link
   - Ensure mobile responsiveness

2. IMPLEMENT FUNCTIONALITY:
   - Email/password authentication
   - Form validation: check email format, enforce password rules
   - Show password toggle icon
   - Prevent access to the dashboard unless the user is authenticated

3. BACKEND:
   - Use Supabase (or AWS Cognito equivalent)
   - Store hashed passwords
   - Use JWT sessions or secure cookies
   - Create demo users:
     - `johnadeyo@hotmail.com` / `Password`
     - `serenaai862@gmail.com` / `Password`

### TASK 2: REAL ESTATE AGENCY CALL ANALYTICS DASHBOARD

DESIGN A BEAUTIFUL DASHBOARD PAGE FOR LOGGED-IN REAL ESTATE AGENCY ADMINS. THE GOAL IS TO TRACK ALL CALL DATA PROCESSED BY SERENA AI FOR THEIR AGENCY.

#### LAYOUT:
- FOUR KPI CARDS (top row):
  1. **Total Calls (This Week)**
  2. **Appointments Booked**
  3. **Average Call Duration**
  4. **Average Call Rating**

- BAR CHART:
  - Title: _Weekly Call Volume_
  - Show calls per day for the past 7 days
  - Use **shadcn/ui** and apply a **custom color scheme** (e.g. soft purple or blue)

- DETAILED CALLS TABLE:
  - Columns:
    - Phone Number
    - Call Duration
    - Call Type (Inbound/Outbound)
    - Appointment Booked (Yes/No)
    - Call Rating (1–5)
    - Timestamp (Readable format)

- BONUS INSIGHTS (THINK LIKE A REAL ESTATE CEO):
  - Identify Peak Call Hours
  - Missed Calls % (use dummy data logic)
  - Call-to-Appointment Conversion Rate
  - Top Performing Day of Week
  - Rating Distribution Pie Chart (Optional)

#### STYLING:
- Use Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components
- Soft gradients or muted palette (no harsh contrasts)
- Rounded cards, subtle shadows, smooth hover effects
- Responsive layout for tablets and desktop

#### TECHNOLOGIES TO USE:
- React or Next.js
- Supabase or AWS Amplify backend
- shadcn/ui components (Card, Table, Chart)
- Chart library: `recharts` or `chart.js`

### DATA SCHEMA SAMPLE (POSTGRES):

```sql
TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  agency_name TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

TABLE calls (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  phone_number TEXT,
  duration_seconds INT,
  call_type TEXT CHECK (call_type IN ('inbound', 'outbound')),
  appointment_booked BOOLEAN,
  rating INT CHECK (rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
  timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

---

### CHAIN OF THOUGHTS REQUIRED:

1. UNDERSTAND: You are designing a secure, beautiful, and agency-customized call dashboard
2. BASICS: Implement auth, create user-specific dashboards, and visualize call data
3. BREAK DOWN: Handle login first → route to protected dashboard → pull personalized data → display insights
4. ANALYZE: What KPIs matter to an agency CEO? Calls per day, quality, appointment outcomes, peak hours
5. BUILD: Use Tailwind, charting libraries, secure backend, and modular React components
6. EDGE CASES: What if no data this week? Show fallback states or encouragement to onboard team
7. FINAL ANSWER: A complete login UI + analytics dashboard with proper data integration and demo content

---

### WHAT NOT TO DO

- DO NOT USE DEFAULT UGLY BOOTSTRAP OR UNSTYLED HTML
- DO NOT IGNORE AUTH LOGIC (NO STATIC LOGIN MOCKUPS)
- NEVER DISPLAY ALL USERS' CALLS (MUST BE USER-SPECIFIC)
- DO NOT OMIT FORM VALIDATION
- AVOID GENERIC KPIS – THINK LIKE A CEO
- NEVER DISPLAY AN EMPTY DASHBOARD WITH NO ANALYTICS

---
